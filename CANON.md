# Zone–Tritone Canon

## Version 1.0 — Immutable Axioms

The following statements define the Zone–Tritone System.  
They form the **non-negotiable foundation** of the theory.

They may be expanded — but never contradicted.

---

### **Axiom 1 — Zones define harmonic color**

The 12-tone system divides into **two whole-tone families**:

- **Zone 1:** C D E F# G# A#
- **Zone 2:** C# D# F G A B

Remaining inside a single zone preserves color without generating dominant gravity.

---

### **Axiom 2 — Tritones define harmonic gravity**

There are exactly **six tritones**.

Each expresses the **3rd & 7th relationship of dominant harmony**  
and anchors directional pull.

---

### **Axiom 3 — Half-steps define motion**

Half-step movement produces **zone-crossing** and therefore direction.  
Whole-step movement preserves zone-stability.

---

### **Axiom 4 — Chromatic tritone motion produces dominant cycles in 4ths**

When a tritone shifts chromatically, the resulting harmonic implication is dominant function descending in 4ths.

This explains:

- dominant cycles
- tritone substitution
- chromatic comping
- altered tensions

---

### **Axiom 5 — Melodic minor is a dual-zone hybrid system**

Melodic minor contains **two active tritone anchors**, therefore expressing **two simultaneous zone-centers**.

It is the structural bridge between zone-stability and dominant gravity.

## Definition of Canon

Canon refers to:

- the axioms above
- definitions in `GLOSSARY.md`
- pedagogical order in `PEDAGOGY.md`
- governance policy in `GOVERNANCE.md`

These define the official Zone–Tritone System.
