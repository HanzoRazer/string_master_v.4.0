# ZT-Band DAW Export

## Quick import
1. Drag `test_feel.mid` into your DAW timeline.
2. Confirm the DAW tempo matches the MIDI tempo (should auto-import).
3. Assign instruments:
   - Comp track → Piano / EP / Guitar
   - Bass track → Bass instrument
   - (If present) Drums track → Drum rack / kit

## Notes
- This export is designed for fast DAW proof-of-sound, not final production polish.
- If instruments sound wrong, override the DAW instrument selection per track.

## Smoke test (60 seconds)
- Press play: no stuck notes, no silence, timing feels correct.
- Export a quick MP3/WAV bounce as proof-of-sound.
