# Zone–Tritone EXPLAIN

## Chord progression

`G7 Cmaj7 Am7 D7`

## Per-chord gravity anchors

| # | Chord | Root | pc | Zone   | Tritone axis (3,7) |
|---|-------|------|----|--------|---------------------|
| 0 | `G7` | G | 7 | Zone 2 | F–B |
| 1 | `Cmaj7` | C | 0 | Zone 1 | E–Bb |
| 2 | `Am7` | A | 9 | Zone 2 | C#–G |
| 3 | `D7` | D | 2 | Zone 1 | C–F# |

## Step-by-step transitions

| From | To | Interval | Zone relation | Explanation |
|------|----|----------|---------------|-------------|
| G | C | 5 st [↑4] | Zone 2 → Zone 1 (zone-cross) | reverse 4th motion (preparation / back-cycle movement) |
| C | A | 9 st | Zone 1 → Zone 2 (zone-cross) | non-standard motion (outside primary gravity patterns) |
| A | D | 5 st [↑4] | Zone 2 → Zone 1 (zone-cross) | reverse 4th motion (preparation / back-cycle movement) |

## Gravity comparison

**Theoretical gravity chain (descending 4ths):**

`G → C → F → Bb`

**Actual progression:**

`G → C → A → D`

## Reading guide

- **Descending 4th (↓4)** steps align with pure functional gravity.
- **Semitone (±1)** steps are chromatic zone-crossings (strong directional pull).
- **Whole-step (±2)** in-zone steps are modal / color motion.
- Other moves are deliberate tension against the gravity grid.

Use this to see how the tune rides, follows, or pushes against the gravity field.
