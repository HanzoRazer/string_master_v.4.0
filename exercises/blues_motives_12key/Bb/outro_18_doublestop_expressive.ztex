program_ref: ../../../programs/blues_motives/blues_12bar_Bb.ztprog
exercise_type: lead_phrase

goals:
  - "Execute double-stops with parallel voice motion"
  - "Control bend pitch when two strings move together"
  - "Transpose from native key A — same shapes, new position"
  - "Primary technique focus: Bend Quarter"

practice_steps:
  - "Play at slow tempo, isolating each quarter-tone bend"
  - "Quarter-tone target is BETWEEN frets — use your ear, not a tuner"
  - "Practice the 'blues curl': push just enough to blur the zone boundary"
