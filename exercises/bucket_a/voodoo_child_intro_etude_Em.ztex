    bars: [5, 6, 7, 8]

goals:
  - "Capture expressive phrasing in E minor modal blues."
  - "Simulate dynamic wah-style contour with bends and glides."
  - "Execute timing variations with rhythmic confidence."
  - "Use the variation segment as contrast -- different articulation, same tonality."

context:
  - "E Dorian = E-F#-G-A-B-C#-D. The C# (natural 6th) is the modal color."
  - "The vamp is a single E7 chord with rhythmic breaks (N.C.)."
  - "Hendrix treats E7 as a playground -- mix major and minor pentatonic freely."
  - "Wah pedal contour: vowel-like dynamics on sustained bends."

practice_steps:
  - "Step 1: Loop the main phrase slowly. Focus on note connections and bends."
  - "Step 2: Play the variation segment -- add grace notes and extra phrasing."
  - "Step 3: Alternate main and variation back-to-back (8-bar cycle)."
  - "Step 4: Improvise a third pass using modal fragments from both segments."
  - "Step 5: Add dynamic contour -- simulate wah with pick attack and volume."

assessment:
  pass_condition:
    - "Main phrase sounds relaxed and expressive, not mechanical."
    - "Bends land on pitch (especially whole-step bends on G string)."
    - "Variation provides audible contrast to the main phrase."
    - "Timing is confident -- notes sit in the pocket, not rushed."
