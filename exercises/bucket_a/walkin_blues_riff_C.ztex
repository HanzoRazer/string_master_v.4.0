program_ref: "programs/bucket_a/walkin_blues_backing_C.ztprog"

midi_segments:
  - part: "main"
    file: "exercises/bucket_a/midi/walkin_blues_main_riff.mid"
    bars: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  - part: "variation"
    file: "exercises/bucket_a/midi/walkin_blues_variation_riff.mid"
    bars: [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

goals:
  - "Internalize 12-bar shuffle riff phrasing."
  - "Connect descending licks with turnaround motion."
  - "Introduce contrast between main phrase and variation."
  - "Feel the delta shuffle -- swing the eighths, lay back."

context:
  - "Standard 12-bar blues in C. Delta/country blues lineage."
  - "Main riff covers bars 1-6 (I-IV territory)."
  - "Variation covers bars 7-12 (I-V turnaround territory)."
  - "Robert Johnson, Son House, Muddy Waters -- this is the root tradition."

practice_steps:
  - "Step 1: Loop the main phrase (bars 1-6) until it feels relaxed."
  - "Step 2: Play the variation riff (bars 7-12) immediately after for contrast."
  - "Step 3: Play both back-to-back as a full 12-bar chorus."
  - "Step 4: Improvise a third pass using elements of both phrases."
  - "Step 5: Try at different tempos -- slow and greasy (52 BPM) vs. driving (96 BPM)."

assessment:
  pass_condition:
    - "12-bar form is solid -- no lost bars."
    - "Shuffle feel is authentic -- eighths swing, not straight."
    - "Variation provides audible contrast to the main riff."
    - "Turnaround (bars 11-12) sets up the loop cleanly."
