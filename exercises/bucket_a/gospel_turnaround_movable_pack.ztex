title: "Gospel Turnaround -- Movable Pack (C / G / D)"
level: "A"
category: "cadence"
concept: "IV -> bVII9 -> Imaj9 -> V13 -> I6 (full gospel turnaround)"

goals:
  - "Play the full gospel turnaround in three keys without stopping."
  - "Recognize the turnaround sound instantly regardless of key."
  - "Move voicing families across the neck by pattern, not memorization."

quick_map:
  C: "Fmaj9 -> Bb9 -> Cmaj9 -> G13 -> C6"
  G: "Cmaj9 -> F9 -> Gmaj9 -> D13 -> G6"
  D: "Gmaj9 -> C9 -> Dmaj9 -> A13 -> D6"

voicing_families:
  - name: "Family 1 -- gospel grabs (open/low zone)"
    examples:
      C_major:
        "IV":    "Fmaj9   x-3-2-0-1-0"
        "bVII9": "Bb9     x-1-0-1-1-1"
        "Imaj9": "Cmaj9   x-3-2-0-3-0"
        "V13":   "G13     3-x-0-0-1-0"
        "I6":    "C6      x-3-2-2-1-0"
      G_major:
        "IV":    "Cmaj9   x-3-2-0-3-0"
        "bVII9": "F9      1-x-1-2-1-x"
        "Imaj9": "Gmaj9   3-x-4-4-3-x"
        "V13":   "D13     x-5-4-5-5-5"
        "I6":    "G6      3-x-2-4-3-x"
      D_major:
        "IV":    "Gmaj9   3-x-4-4-3-x"
        "bVII9": "C9      x-3-2-3-3-x"
        "Imaj9": "Dmaj9   x-5-4-2-5-x"
        "V13":   "A13     x-0-4-5-5-5"
        "I6":    "D6      x-5-4-4-5-x"

guide_tone_map:
  C: "D->E (Bb9->C), B->C (G13->C6)"
  G: "A->B (F9->G), F#->G (D13->G6)"
  D: "E->F# (C9->D), C#->D (A13->D6)"

rhythm:
  feel: "soul/gospel"
  tips:
    - "Same timing rules in every key: push bVII9, relax into I."
    - "V13 hangs -- let it simmer before resolving to I6."
    - "When switching keys, take a breath on the last I6 before the new IV."

practice_steps:
  - "Step 1: Play the full turnaround in C for 4 cycles."
  - "Step 2: Same in G for 4 cycles."
  - "Step 3: Same in D for 4 cycles."
  - "Step 4: Chain all three keys back-to-back (C -> G -> D), 2 cycles each."
  - "Step 5: Add the chromatic lick (3-4-#4-5) at each bVII9 -> I transition."
  - "Step 6: Randomize key order. Can you start in D? In G?"

assessment:
  pass_condition:
    - "All three keys played without losing time."
    - "The turnaround sounds consistent across keys."
    - "Guide-tone resolutions are audible in every key."
    - "Key transitions are smooth (no long pauses between keys)."
