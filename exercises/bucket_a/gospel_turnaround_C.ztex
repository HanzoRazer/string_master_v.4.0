id: gospel_turnaround_C
title: "Gospel Turnaround (IV -> bVII9 -> I -> V13 -> I6) -- C Major"
level: "A"
category: "cadence"
key_center: "C"

program_ref: "programs/bucket_a/gospel_turnaround_C.ztprog"

goals:
  - "Play the full gospel turnaround as one flowing phrase."
  - "Hear the backdoor (Bb9 -> Cmaj9) resolve, then the V13 reentry."
  - "Keep top voices smooth -- max one step between adjacent chords."
  - "Internalize the 'sigh into home' feel on the final C6."

context:
  - "The backdoor cadence (IV -> bVII7 -> I) is the first half."
  - "G13 -> C6 is a standard V -> I turnaround that loops the phrase."
  - "Together they make a complete gospel turnaround cycle."
  - "This is the progression gospel pianists and R&B guitarists use constantly."

    chords:
      F6_9:    "x-3-2-2-3-x"
      Bb13:    "x-1-1-1-3-3"
      Cmaj9:   "x-3-2-0-3-0"
      G13:     "3-x-0-0-1-0"
      C6_9:    "x-3-2-2-3-0"

rhythm:
  feel: "soul/gospel"
  tips:
    - "Anticipate Bb9 by an eighth-note (push slightly before beat 3)."
    - "Let Cmaj9 sit and breathe -- don't rush to G13."
    - "G13 creates tension; let it hang for a full bar before resolving."
    - "C6 lands relaxed and warm -- this is 'home.'"

practice_steps:
  - "Step 1: Play Fmaj9 -> Bb9 -> Cmaj9 only. 2 bars each. Focus on smooth top voice."
  - "Step 2: Add G13 -> C6 at the end. Now you have the full 5-chord turnaround."
  - "Step 3: Loop the full cycle (C6 feeds back to Fmaj9). No gaps."
  - "Step 4: Try Set B (mid-neck). Same sound, different shapes."
  - "Step 5: Try Set C (color upgrades). Listen for the richer extensions."
  - "Step 6: Experiment with gospel timing -- push and delay chords around the beat."

assessment:
  pass_condition:
    - "Full turnaround loops without rhythmic breaks."
    - "Guide-tone resolutions are audible (especially D->E and B->C)."
    - "Top voice moves by step, never leaps."
    - "Feel is relaxed and warm, not mechanical."
