title: "Gospel Chromatic Lick (bVII7 -> I) -- C Major"
level: "A"
category: "lick"
key_center: "C"

program_ref: "programs/bucket_a/gospel_turnaround_C.ztprog"

goals:
  - "Play the chromatic 3-4-#4-5 fill over the Bb7 -> C change."
  - "Land the G (5th of C) on beat 1 of the resolution chord."
  - "Feel the chromatic pull: each note tightens until release."

context:
  - "This lick sits over the bVII7 -> I moment in the backdoor cadence."
  - "The notes E-F-F#-G span the 3rd to 5th of C major."
  - "F# is the chromatic passing tone -- it creates the 'butter' feel."
  - "Gospel, R&B, and soul guitarists use this constantly."

lick:
  name: "Chromatic butter (Bb7 -> C)"
  degrees: "3 - 4 - #4 - 5"
  notes: "E - F - F# - G"
  timing: "eighth-notes leading into beat 1"
  tab:
    high_e: "0 - 1 - 2 - 3"
    b_string: "5 - 6 - 7 - 8"
    g_string: "9 - 10 - 11 - 12"

variations:
  - name: "Descending approach"
    degrees: "5 - #4 - 4 - 3 - 5"
    notes: "G - F# - F - E - G"
    description: "Start on the target, dip down chromatically, return."
  - name: "Double-time fill"
    degrees: "3 - 4 - #4 - 5 - 3 - 4 - #4 - 5"
    notes: "E - F - F# - G - E - F - F# - G"
    description: "Sixteenth-notes: run the chromatic line twice in one bar."
  - name: "Bend variant"
    degrees: "3 - (bend 4 to #4) - 5"
    notes: "E - (F bent to F#) - G"
    description: "Bend the 4th up a half-step instead of fretting F#. Blues/gospel flavor."

practice_steps:
  - "Step 1: Play E-F-F#-G slowly (quarter notes) over Bb7 -> C. Hear each note."
  - "Step 2: Speed up to eighth notes. Land G on beat 1 of C chord."
  - "Step 3: Loop the turnaround. Insert the lick every time Bb9 appears."
  - "Step 4: Try on the B string (frets 5-6-7-8) and G string (9-10-11-12)."
  - "Step 5: Try the descending and bend variants."

assessment:
  pass_condition:
    - "G lands cleanly on beat 1 of the I chord."
    - "Chromatic notes are even (no rushing F# -> G)."
    - "Lick flows naturally within the turnaround groove."
    - "At least one variation attempted."
