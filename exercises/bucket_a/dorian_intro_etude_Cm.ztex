level: "A"
category: "modal_phrase"

mode: "dorian"

program_ref: "programs/bucket_a/dorian_vamp_Cm.ztprog"

midi_segments:
  - part: "main"
    file: "exercises/bucket_a/midi/beginning_intro_dorian_etude.mid"
    bars: [1, 2, 3, 4]

goals:
  - "Explore phrasing using the C Dorian mode."
  - "Target the natural 6th (A) to reinforce modal color."
  - "Blend blues licks with modal phrasing over C minor."
  - "Distinguish Dorian from Aeolian -- A natural vs Ab."

context:
  - "C Dorian = C-D-Eb-F-G-A-Bb. The A natural separates it from C Aeolian (Ab)."
  - "Over Cm7/Cm9, the A natural sounds warm and jazzy, not dark."
  - "Hendrix used Dorian constantly -- 'Little Wing' and 'Bold As Love' are touchstones."
  - "This is the static-vamp foundation. See dorian_gospel_backdoor_Cm.ztex for harmonic expansion."

practice_steps:
  - "Step 1: Loop the phrase slowly. Feel the C Dorian intervals."
  - "Step 2: Emphasize the A natural as the modal color tone."
  - "Step 3: Contrast A natural (Dorian) with Ab (Aeolian). Hear the difference."
  - "Step 4: Use the descending segment to create your own modal riffs."
  - "Step 5: When comfortable, graduate to dorian_gospel_backdoor_Cm.ztex for harmonic motion."

assessment:
  pass_condition:
    - "A natural is audible as a deliberate color choice, not accidental."
    - "Phrasing is relaxed and expressive -- Hendrix vibe."
    - "Can distinguish this from Aeolian by ear."
    - "At least one original riff created using the descending segment."
