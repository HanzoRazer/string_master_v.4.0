# 📘 **Zone–Tritone Instructor Certification Guide**

*A formal program for training, authorizing, and safeguarding the Zone–Tritone lineage.*

---

## 🎯 **Purpose**

The Instructor Certification Program exists to ensure that the **Zone–Tritone System is taught accurately, consistently, and ethically** according to the Canon (`CANON.md`), Glossary (`GLOSSARY.md`), and Pedagogical Sequence (`PEDAGOGY.md`).

Certification protects:

✔ **the integrity of the theory**
✔ **the learning experience of students**
✔ **the lineage & authorship of the founder**

Certified instructors are stewards — not owners — of the canon.

---

## 🏛 **Core Instructional Principle**

> **Theory must always serve sound.
> Language must remain canonical.
> Extensions must remain consistent.**

Any instruction violating these principles is **non-canonical.**

---

# 🥇 **Certification Levels**

The program consists of **three tiers**. Each tier expands scope — never contradicting the core.

---

until Level 2 certification is granted.

---

## **Level 2 — Certified Gravity & Motion Instructor (CG-I)**

**Scope:** Teach Levels 1–4 of the canonical pedagogy.

### Additional Requirements

✔ deep understanding of **chromatic tritone drift**
✔ ability to demonstrate **dominant cycles descending in 4ths**
✔ ability to teach direction vs stability by sound

They **may NOT modify canon.**

---

# 📐 **Canonical Teaching Rules**

All certified instructors must comply with the following:

---

## **Rule 1 — Teach in Order**

Levels must never be skipped.

❌ No altered dominance before gravity training
❌ No hybrid systems before zone fluency
❌ No advanced substitution before motion clarity

This prevents cognitive fragmentation.

---

## **Rule 2 — Use Canonical Language Only**

Teaching must align with:

* `CANON.md`
* `GLOSSARY.md`
* `PEDAGOGY.md`

❌ No redefining terms
❌ No mixing terminology from unrelated theory systems
✔ Clarify using sound and examples
✔ Translate ideas, not definitions

---

## **Rule 3 — Sound Comes First**

Students must:

✔ sing
✔ play
✔ hear
✔ identify motion by ear

**before academic labels are applied.**

---

## **Rule 4 — Theory Serves the Ear, not Ego**

Zone–Tritone instruction forbids:

❌ stylized dogma
❌ elitist framing
❌ self-promotion over lineage
❌ intellectual gatekeeping

The educator is a **guide**, not a gate.

---

## **Rule 5 — Explicit System Attribution**

Instructors must acknowledge:

> "This system is derived from the Zone–Tritone framework founded by Greg Brown."

This preserves historical authorship and avoids appropriation.

---

# 🛡 **Ethics & Conduct**

Certified instructors agree to:

✔ honor the intellectual integrity of the system
✔ teach responsibly
✔ protect students
✔ avoid abuse of authority
✔ maintain humility
✔ remain open to correction when needed

Violations may result in **revocation of certification.**

---

# 📜 **Certification Renewal**

Certification renews every **3 years** via:

✔ demonstration of continued alignment
✔ updated knowledge review
✔ short refresher interview

This protects against drift and mutation.

---

# ⚖️ **Disciplinary Process**

Certification may be suspended if an instructor:

❌ teaches contradictory doctrine
❌ rewrites or misrepresents core definitions
❌ claims unauthorized authority
❌ acts unethically toward students or peers
❌ uses the system for coercive or exploitative means

Process:

1️⃣ Written concern submitted
2️⃣ Review by MZT-E panel
3️⃣ Response opportunity granted
4️⃣ Resolution or revocation

This is done with **dignity and fairness.**

---

# 🧭 **Instructor Oath**

Before certification, instructors affirm:

> *I commit to teach the Zone–Tritone System faithfully,
> to respect its canon and lineage,
> to serve the ears and hearts of learners,
> and to protect the integrity of the framework entrusted to me.*

---

# 🌱 **Why This Matters**

This guide ensures that the Zone–Tritone System remains:

✔ coherent
✔ disciplined
✔ philosophically consistent
✔ spiritually respectful
✔ educationally excellent
✔ protected from dilution

So that **future generations inherit a living, structured discipline — not scattered fragments.**
