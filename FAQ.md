# Zone–Tritone System FAQ

*Answering common questions from skeptics, students, and educators.*

---

## 🎯 **For Skeptics**

### **Q: Why create a new theory system? Isn't traditional harmony enough?**

Traditional harmony teaches **chord-symbol memorization** and **pattern recognition** without explaining **why** certain progressions work.

The Zone–Tritone System reveals the **structural cause** of harmonic motion:

- Why dominant chords resolve
- Why tritone substitution works
- Why melodic minor sounds different
- Why descending 4ths create momentum

It's not a replacement — it's the **underlying physics**.

---

### **Q: Is this just rebranding whole-tone scales?**

No.

Whole-tone scales are **vertical sonorities** (chords/colors).

The Zone–Tritone System uses whole-tone **families** as **organizational categories** to explain:

- why half-steps create direction
- why whole-steps preserve stability
- how tritones anchor dominant function

The zones are **conceptual tools**, not scales to play over changes.

---

### **Q: Does this work outside of jazz?**

Yes.

The system applies to:

✔ Classical voice-leading
✔ Pop/rock progressions
✔ Film scoring
✔ Contemporary composition
✔ Electronic music
✔ Any harmonic motion involving dominant function

If your music uses tritones, half-steps, or resolution, this system describes it.

---

### **Q: Why does this need to be "protected" and "canonical"?**

Because theoretical drift destroys clarity.

When terminology shifts, students get confused.  
When pedagogy fragments, learning becomes chaotic.

The canon protects:

✔ consistent language
✔ reliable teaching
✔ clear progression through concepts

This is how **real disciplines** (mathematics, linguistics, martial arts) preserve knowledge.

---

### **Q: Can I teach this without certification?**

You can explore and discuss the theory freely.

However, **formal instruction** that claims authority requires certification to ensure:

- accurate terminology
- proper pedagogical order
- alignment with canon
- ethical teaching practices

This protects students from misinformation.

---

## 🎓 **For Students**

### **Q: Do I need to unlearn traditional theory?**

No.

The Zone–Tritone System **explains why traditional theory works**.

You'll see chord progressions, voice-leading, and substitutions in a new light — but your existing knowledge remains valid.

This system connects the dots.

---

### **Q: How long does it take to learn?**

That depends on your current level:

- **Beginners:** 6–12 months for solid foundation
- **Intermediate players:** 3–6 months to integrate concepts
- **Advanced musicians:** 1–3 months to restructure understanding

The key is **progressing through levels in order** (see `PEDAGOGY.md`).

---

### **Q: Do I need perfect pitch?**

No.

The system trains **relative pitch** and **conceptual hearing**.

You'll learn to:

✔ recognize zone-stability by feel
✔ hear tritone gravity by direction
✔ identify motion by half-step vs whole-step energy

Perfect pitch is helpful but not required.

---

### **Q: What if I can't sing?**

Singing is a **learning tool**, not a performance skill.

You don't need a beautiful voice — you need to:

✔ match pitches
✔ feel intervals in your body
✔ internalize motion

This trains your **ear-brain connection**.

If you can hum, you can learn.

---

### **Q: Can I use this for improvisation?**

Absolutely.

The system teaches you to:

✔ navigate changes by **gravity**, not memorized patterns
✔ hear tensions as **zone-crossings**
✔ anticipate resolution by **tritone direction**
✔ comp with intentional harmonic motion

You'll improvise with **structural awareness**, not just scale choices.

---

### **Q: Will this help me pass Real Book standards?**

Yes.

The system explains **why** standard progressions work, which makes:

- changes easier to hear
- substitutions more intuitive
- voice-leading smoother
- comping more intentional

You'll see the **architecture** behind the tunes.

---

## 🎼 **For Educators**

### **Q: Can I integrate this into my existing curriculum?**

Yes — with proper attribution and alignment to canon.

The system can:

✔ supplement traditional harmony courses
✔ enhance ear-training programs
✔ clarify jazz theory instruction
✔ deepen composition pedagogy

Just follow the pedagogical sequence and use canonical terminology.

---

### **Q: What if my teaching philosophy differs?**

You're free to teach using your own methods **as long as you don't claim canonical authority**.

If you teach the Zone–Tritone System, you must:

✔ respect the canon
✔ use frozen terminology
✔ follow pedagogical order
✔ attribute the framework to Greg Brown

If you want to create a derivative system, that's your choice — but it can't be called "Zone–Tritone."

---

### **Q: How do I assess student progress?**

Use the six-level structure from `PEDAGOGY.md`:

1. Can they identify zone membership by ear?
2. Can they locate tritone anchors?
3. Can they feel half-step motion as directional energy?
4. Can they navigate dual-zone harmony?
5. Can they compose using gravity maps?
6. Do they express mastery philosophy?

Each level has clear, testable outcomes.

---

### **Q: Can I create my own teaching materials?**

Yes — as long as they align with canon and don't contradict axioms.

You may:

✔ create exercises
✔ compose examples
✔ design visual aids
✔ develop assessment tools

But terminology and core concepts must remain canonical.

---

## 🔬 **Theoretical Questions**

### **Q: How does this relate to Schenkerian analysis?**

The Zone–Tritone System focuses on **harmonic motion** and **dominant function**.

Schenker focuses on **prolongation** and **linear reduction**.

They address different aspects of musical structure.

The systems are **compatible** but serve different purposes.

---

### **Q: What about modal harmony?**

Modal harmony emphasizes **color** over **direction**.

In Zone–Tritone terms, modal music often stays within **one zone** (zone-stability) to avoid dominant gravity.

When modal music uses half-step motion, it creates momentary **zone-crossing** — which is why it sounds directional.

The system explains the **difference** between modal and tonal thinking.

---

### **Q: Does this explain atonal music?**

The system describes **tonal gravity**.

Atonal music deliberately avoids tritone anchors and gravitational resolution.

However, the Zone–Tritone framework can analyze:

- **when** atonal music uses gravity (even briefly)
- **how** composers avoid it
- **why** certain pitch relationships feel stable or unstable

It's a tool for understanding structure — not a prescription.

---

### **Q: What about microtonal music?**

The current canon addresses the **12-tone equal temperament system**.

Extensions to microtonal systems are possible but require:

✔ written proposals
✔ governance review
✔ demonstration of non-contradiction

This is future work.

---

## ⚙️ **Practical Applications**

### **Q: Can I build software/apps using this system?**

Yes.

Software implementations are encouraged.

Potential applications:

✔ Ear-training apps
✔ Composition tools
✔ Harmonic analysis software
✔ Interactive teaching platforms
✔ Notation plugins

Software may be open-source — but the **theory framework** remains protected intellectual property (see `LICENSE-THEORY.md`).

---

### **Q: Are there existing tools I can use?**

Not yet — this is a new framework.

If you build tools, please:

✔ respect canonical terminology
✔ attribute the system properly
✔ align with axioms
✔ share with the community

---

### **Q: Can I use this for songwriting?**

Absolutely.

The system helps you:

✔ compose with intentional harmonic motion
✔ control tension and release
✔ create unexpected but logical progressions
✔ understand why certain changes work

You'll write from **gravity**, not just chord memory.

If you have questions not answered here, approach them with:

✔ curiosity
✔ respect for the canon
✔ commitment to clarity
✔ willingness to listen

Theory is a map — not the territory.

**Trust your ears.**
