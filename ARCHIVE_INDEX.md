# MASTER CATALOG — ARCHIVE INGEST (v1.2)

## BUCKET A — **Symmetry / Cycles / Interval Systems**

> Core intellectual DNA of your work

These are about **movement, symmetry, and partitioning of the octave**.

### Files

* **The Circle of 3rds.docx**
* **Playing In Thirds.docx**
* **Playing in 4ths.docx**
* **The Scale of 10ths in D Minor.docx**
* **Playing In 10ths.docx**
* **Using The Whole Tone Scale.docx**
* **The Barry Harris Diminished Scale.docx**

### What these really are

* Interval-motion systems
* Symmetric vs diatonic partitions
* Horizontal harmony generators

### Why they matter

These map **directly** to:

* Tritone Zone theory
* Your MIDI generator's interval logic
* Style behaviors (not "lessons")

👉 These are **engine-level behaviors**, not content.

---

## BUCKET B — **Dominant Motion / Tritone / Resolution Mechanics**

> Gravity, tension, release

### Files

* **Tritone Substitutions.docx**
* **Leading Tones.docx**
* **Hharmonic Concepts.docx**
* **Hharmonic Concepts – Rhythm Changes.docx**
* **Melodic Minor Scale with Dominant 7th Chord Progression1.docx**

### What these really are

* Dominant resolution rules
* Chromatic voice-leading
* Tritone equivalence
* Bebop / jazz gravity

### Why they matter

This is the **decision layer**:

* Why the engine chooses *this* chord next
* Why substitutions work
* Why symmetry resolves

👉 This bucket feeds **harmonic decision-making**, not voicing.

### 📄 Leading Tones.docx (detailed)

**What it is**

* Straightforward explanation of:
  * Leading tone = 7th scale degree
  * Half-step resolution to tonic
  * Difference between major, natural minor, harmonic/melodic minor
  * Role in dominant 7th and diminished chords

**Why it matters**

* This document is **foundational gravity logic**, not style.
* It underpins:
  * Tritone resolution
  * Dominant → tonic behavior
  * Why altered tones "want" to resolve

**Catalog status**

* ✅ Core theory reference
* 🔁 Duplicates ideas elsewhere, but this is the **cleanest baseline definition**
* 🧠 Feeds harmonic decision rules, not voicing

**Action**

* Keep as **reference-only**
* Do **not** operationalize directly
* Use as a sanity check for engine behavior

---

## BUCKET C — **Chord Vocabulary & Voicing Systems**

> Vertical structure / texture

### Files

* **How to Play Triads in the key of A Major.docx**
* **Drop 2 & 3 Chords System.docx**
* **Drop 2 & 3 Chords System1.docx**
* **A Minor Chords.docx**
* **Ppentatonic Scale Chord Progression.docx**

### What these really are

* Voicing inventories
* Chord families
* Guitar/piano-friendly shapes

### Why they matter

These are **rendering instructions**:

* How harmony is *voiced*
* Register management
* Texture realism for MIDI

👉 These do *not* decide harmony — they **express** it.

---

## BUCKET D — **Formulas / Progressions / Cultural Harmonic Forms**

> Reusable musical structures

### Files

* **Jazz BluesInbox.docx**
* **Andalusian Cadence .docx**
* **Salsa Music Accompaniment Pattern.docx**
* **Dance Style Rhythms.docx**

### What these really are

* Cultural grammar
* Time-feel + harmonic loops
* Ostinato logic

### Why they matter

These are **preset seeds**:

* Practice packs
* Style engines
* DAW-ready templates

👉 Perfect candidates for `.ztprog` and `.ztex`.

---

## BUCKET E — **Meta-Systems / Pedagogy / Product Vision**

> How the music is *delivered*, not played

### Files

* **UNIVERSAL CHORD AND RIFF METHOD.docx**
* **Iinteractive Multimedia Software.docx**

### What these really are

* Framework thinking
* Interactive learning vision
* System-level pedagogy

### Why they matter

These are **north-star documents**:

* They guide *how* users interact
* Not meant to be implemented wholesale
* Inform UX and feature direction later

👉 These should **never** be rushed into code.

---

## BUCKET F — **Physical Technique / Motor-Control Systems**

> These are *not* harmony — they are **embodied mechanics**

### Files

* **Ffretboard Exercise.docx**

### 📄 Ffretboard Exercise.docx (detailed)

**What it is**

* Detailed finger-independence drills
* Three-note-per-string–inspired hand positions
* Fixed index finger, independent movement of other fingers
* Cross-string repetition
* Picking patterns (Paul Gilbert–style)

**What it's really about**

* Motor isolation
* Hand stability
* Coordination between fretting & picking

**Why it matters**

* This is **not theory**
* This is **execution infrastructure**
* It explains *why* certain interval systems are playable

**Catalog status**

* ✅ Valuable
* ❌ Should not influence MIDI logic directly
* ✔ Perfect candidate for:
  * Future interactive trainer
  * Visualized practice mode
  * Non-audio feedback systems

**Action**

* Archive under **Technique / Physical Systems**
* Do **not** mix with harmonic buckets
* Keep for long-term interactive tooling

---

## BUCKET G — **Visuals / Diagrams / Fretboard PDFs**

> Reference imagery, not executable logic

### Files

* *(PDFs: fretboard diagrams, chord charts, scale shapes)*

### What these really are

* Static visual aids
* Print-ready reference material
* Historical teaching artifacts

### Why they matter

* Useful for **human learners**
* Not useful for **code**
* May inform future visualization features

👉 Archive only. Do not operationalize.

---

## BUCKET H — **Licks / Phrase Sketches**

> Musical fragments, not systems

### Files

* *(Phrase ideas, melodic fragments, riff sketches)*

### What these really are

* Raw musical material
* Potential seeds for pattern libraries
* Personal vocabulary snapshots

### Why they matter

* May inspire future `.ztprog` content
* Not structural — purely content-level
* Keep separate from engine logic

👉 Content layer, not behavior layer.

---

## BUCKET I — **Prototypes / Old Scripts / Experiments**

> Historical code attempts

### Files

* *(Old Python scripts, abandoned experiments, early versions)*

### What these really are

* Learning artifacts
* Superseded approaches
* Archaeological evidence of evolution

### Why they matter

* Show where you came from
* May contain buried ideas worth revisiting
* Should **never** be merged into current codebase

👉 Read-only archive. Do not resurrect without review.

# Key Insight (important)

You now clearly have **two orthogonal dimensions** in your archive:

1. **Sound logic** (what notes move where)
2. **Body logic** (how hands execute patterns)

You instinctively kept them separate — which is *correct*.

Most systems confuse these. You didn't.

---

# What This Catalog Tells You

### 1️⃣ You were not random

Your archive is **coherent**.
You explored the same idea through:

* intervals
* voicings
* gravity
* rhythm
* pedagogy

### 2️⃣ Most files are **behavioral**, not instructional

Which means:

* They belong in a **generator**
* Not as PDFs
* Not as theory lessons

### 3️⃣ You already separated concerns (without realizing it)

You instinctively split:

* *What happens* (Buckets A & B)
* *How it sounds* (Bucket C)
* *Where it lives* (Bucket D)
* *How it's taught* (Bucket E)
* *How hands move* (Bucket F)

That's solid engineering instinct.

# Suggested Next Micro-Step (no documents)

If you want to keep going *without* generating sprawl:

* Create **one top-level folder**:

  ```
  ARCHIVE/
    A_symmetry/
    B_gravity/
    C_voicing/
    D_forms/
    E_pedagogy/
    F_technique/
  ```

Move files. Stop.

No rewriting.
No summarizing.
No converting.

Just **containment**.

When you're ready, we can later:

* Promote 3–5 items into "active behaviors"
* Leave the rest safely archived

You're doing exactly what a long-term builder eventually has to do:
**reconcile the archive with the present system.**
