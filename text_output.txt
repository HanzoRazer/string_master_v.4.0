G   -> C      5 st [↑4]  Zone 2 -> Zone 1 (zone-cross)     reverse 4th motion (preparation / back-cycle movement)

# Gravity comparison:
  Theoretical gravity chain (descending 4ths):
   G -> C
  Actual progression:
   G -> C

# Reading guide:
  • Descending 4th (↓4) steps align with pure functional gravity.
  • Semitone (±1) steps are chromatic zone-crossings (strong direction).
  • Whole-step (±2) in-zone steps are modal / color motion.
  • Everything else is a deliberate tension against the gravity grid.

  Use this to see how the tune rides, follows, or fights the gravity field.
