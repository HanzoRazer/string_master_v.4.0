## Step-by-step transitions

| From | To | Interval | Zone relation | Explanation |
|------|----|----------|---------------|-------------|
| D | G | 5 st [↑4] | Zone 1 → Zone 2 (zone-cross) | reverse 4th motion (preparation / back-cycle movement) |
| G | E | 9 st | Zone 2 → Zone 1 (zone-cross) | non-standard motion (outside primary gravity patterns) |
| E | A | 5 st [↑4] | Zone 1 → Zone 2 (zone-cross) | reverse 4th motion (preparation / back-cycle movement) |
| A | D | 5 st [↑4] | Zone 2 → Zone 1 (zone-cross) | reverse 4th motion (preparation / back-cycle movement) |
| D | G | 5 st [↑4] | Zone 1 → Zone 2 (zone-cross) | reverse 4th motion (preparation / back-cycle movement) |
| G | C | 5 st [↑4] | Zone 2 → Zone 1 (zone-cross) | reverse 4th motion (preparation / back-cycle movement) |

## Gravity comparison

**Theoretical gravity chain (descending 4ths):**

`D → G → C → F → Bb → Eb → Ab`

**Actual progression:**

`D → G → E → A → D → G → C`

## Reading guide

- **Descending 4th (↓4)** steps align with pure functional gravity.
- **Semitone (±1)** steps are chromatic zone-crossings (strong directional pull).
- **Whole-step (±2)** in-zone steps are modal / color motion.
- Other moves are deliberate tension against the gravity grid.

Use this to see how the tune rides, follows, or pushes against the gravity field.
