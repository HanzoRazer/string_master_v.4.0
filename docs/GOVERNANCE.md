# Governance & Version Policy

The Zone–Tritone System is governed to prevent drift.

---

## Canon Versions

### v1.x
Core axioms, terminology & pedagogy only.

Minor edits = clarification, not modification.

### v2.x and beyond
New subsystems may be added **only if non-contradictory.**

## Change Approval

Any change to:

- CANON.md  
- GLOSSARY.md  
- PEDAGOGY.md  

requires:

✔ written proposal  
✔ review  
✔ founder approval  

No fork may claim canonical status without governance process.
