## Grading Philosophy

### Assessment Principles

✔ **Sound comes first** — Aural skills weighted heavily  
✔ **Application over memorization** — Practical demonstration required  
✔ **Progressive mastery** — Each level builds on previous  
✔ **Consistency required** — One good performance isn't enough  
✔ **Canon alignment** — Terminology and concepts must be canonical  

### Passing Standards Rationale

- **Level 1-2**: 70-75% (foundational, exploration encouraged)
- **Level 3-4**: 80% (competence required for advanced work)
- **Level 5-6**: 85-90% (mastery expected)
- **Certification**: 90-95% (teaching authority requires excellence)

✔ Receive specific feedback on weak areas  
✔ Access additional exercises and materials  
✔ Request one-on-one coaching (if available)  

**Maximum attempts**: 3 per level before requiring restart from previous level

---

## Record Keeping

Certified instructors must maintain:

✔ Student assessment scores and dates  
✔ Written feedback for each assessment  
✔ Progress notes documenting journey  
✔ Certification level and date issued  

**Privacy**: Student records confidential, shared only with governance approval

## Accessibility Accommodations

Assessments may be adapted for:

✔ Visual impairments (aural-only formats)  
✔ Hearing impairments (visual notation emphasis)  
✔ Physical limitations (alternate performance methods)  
✔ Learning differences (extended time, modified formats)  

**Core requirement**: Conceptual understanding must still be demonstrated

---

## Quality Assurance

Assessment quality maintained through:

✔ Standardized rubrics across all instructors  
✔ Periodic calibration workshops  
✔ Student outcome tracking  
✔ Peer review of assessment practices  
✔ Continuous improvement based on data
