# Tritone–Zone Theory: Foundational Axioms (v1)

## Scope

These axioms describe tonal gravity in 12-TET using symmetry, tritones, and whole-tone partitions.
They do not replace functional harmony; they re-express it.

---

## Axiom 1 — Tritone Primacy

Tritones are the fundamental carriers of tonal gravity.

In any key, the defining gravitational force is the tritone formed by:

- the leading tone
- and its opposing tendency tone

In major keys, this tritone is the 3rd–7th of the dominant.

Tonality is perceived through resolution of tritone tension, not merely root motion.

**Consequence:**
Chords, scales, and progressions derive their function from embedded tritones, not chord labels.

---

## Axiom 2 — Tritone Invariance

There exist exactly six unique tritones in 12-TET.

- Each tritone is self-inverting.
- All twelve pitch classes are generated by transposition of these six pairs.
- Tritone identity is preserved under inversion and transposition.

**Consequence:**
Tonal systems are finite and cyclical, not open-ended.

---

## Axiom 3 — Dual-Tritone Minor

Minor tonalities contain two active tritones.

- Major tonality uses one primary tritone.
- Melodic minor, harmonic minor, and harmonic major introduce a second tritone, typically beginning on ♭3.
- These two tritones form a symmetrical tension field.

**Consequence:**
Minor tonalities feel richer, darker, or more complex because two independent gravity centers coexist.

---

## Axiom 4 — Symmetry as Structural Truth

Symmetry governs all stable pitch collections.

Only three pitch collections are fully symmetrical:

- Chromatic scale
- Whole-tone scale
- Diminished scale

All tonal scales are intentional asymmetries carved out of symmetry.

**Consequence:**
Tonality is not natural chaos — it is controlled symmetry-breaking.

---

## Axiom 5 — Whole-Tone Partition

The chromatic set divides into two complementary whole-tone zones.

- Zone A and Zone B each contain six notes.
- Movement within a zone produces ambiguity.
- Movement between zones (by half-step) produces function and direction.

**Consequence:**
Alterations, tensions, and "outside" notes are zone crossings, not exceptions.

---

## Axiom 6 — Half-Step as Boundary Crossing

Half-steps represent transitions between whole-tone zones.

- They restore asymmetry.
- They create expectation.
- They define resolution.

**Consequence:**
All functional harmony is traceable to zone transitions via half-step motion.

---

## Axiom 7 — Modal Perception Through Zone Stability

Modal character is determined by when zone crossings occur.

- Early crossing → instability (minor / darker modes)
- Delayed crossing → brightness (Lydian)
- Even spacing → ambiguity (whole-tone / diminished)

**Consequence:**
Modes are perceived by tension timing, not scale degree naming.

---

## Axiom 8 — Dominant Motion as Tritone Translation

Chromatic dominant motion results from half-step displacement of tritones.

- Moving a tritone by semitone produces a new dominant function.

This explains:

- Tritone substitution
- Chromatic dominants
- Descending-fourth cycles

**Consequence:**
What looks like "chromaticism" is structured tritone migration.

---

## Axiom 9 — Visual Cognition Supremacy

The human mind learns tonal systems more efficiently through symmetry than function labels.

- Fretboards, keyboards, and grids expose symmetry directly.
- Tritone pairs and whole-tone zones map cleanly onto these interfaces.

**Consequence:**
This theory is instrument-native, not abstract.

---

## Axiom 10 — Tonality as Constraint System

Tonality is defined by constraints on symmetry, not by note sets.

A key is a rule set governing:

- which tritones are active
- which zone crossings are allowed
- when resolution must occur

**Consequence:**
Tonality can be modeled algorithmically without naming chords.

---

## Why This Matters

This axiom set is:

- ✔️ Musically correct
- ✔️ Computationally implementable
- ✔️ Pedagogically powerful
- ✔️ Compatible with jazz, classical, and modern harmony
- ✔️ Stable enough to be a canon

Nothing here contradicts traditional theory — it re-indexes it.

## Next Steps (When You Say So)

Only after these axioms are locked do we proceed to:

1. **Exercise generators** (derived directly from axioms)
2. **zt-band rule logic** (axioms → code constraints)

When you're ready, say:

> "Lock Axioms v1 and proceed to #2."
