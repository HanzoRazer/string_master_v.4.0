# Zone–Tritone Glossary (Canonical)

This glossary defines the **official terminology** of the system.  
Terms are **frozen** and cannot be casually redefined.

---

### Zone
One of two whole-tone families.

### Zone-Stability
Remaining inside one zone.

### Zone-Crossing
Half-step motion between zones.

### Tritone Anchor
The active tritone defining dominant gravity.

### Anchor Exchange
The reinterpretation of a tritone as a second dominant function (tritone substitution).

### Gravity Chain
A sequence of chromatically shifting tritones producing dominant cycles descending in 4ths.

### Dual-Zone Harmony
Harmonic space in which two tritones operate simultaneously (e.g., melodic minor).

### Color Field
A harmonic environment defined by single-zone stability.

### Chromatic Drift
Half-step tritone migration.

### Resolution Target
The harmonic tone or chord where gravity terminates.
