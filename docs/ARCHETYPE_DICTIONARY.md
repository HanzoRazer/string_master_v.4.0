## How to Read This Dictionary

Each archetype defines a **family** of blues motives that share the same structural mechanism. The zone-tritone gravity type tells you *why* the motive resolves. The cadential function tells you *where* it sits in a song.

### Gravity Types

| Type | Mechanism | Zone-Tritone Basis |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **front_door** | V7 -> I resolution | Tritone axis of V7 resolves by half-step to 1 and 3 of I |
| **semitone** | bII -> I chromatic approach | Zone-crossing half-step creates directional gravity |
| **dim_chromatic** | Diminished passing between dominants | Symmetric diminished chord bridges two tritone axes |
| **static** | No harmonic motion | Stays in zone; riff energy, not gravity |
| **expressive** | Expression over structure | Bends/vibrato create tension without cadential resolution |

## DESC_LINE_TURNAROUND

**What it is**: A descending chromatic or diatonic line — typically root, b7, 6, b6 (or similar) — that creates a turnaround back to V or I. The most common blues intro/outro device.

**Gravity**: front_door (descending line implies V -> I)

**Zone-tritone connection**: The descending chromatic steps are zone-crossing moves. Each half-step alternates zones, creating directional energy that pulls toward the target chord.

**Cadential function**: Intros land on V (sets up first verse). Outros land on I (final resolution).

**Transposition rule**: The line shape is key-independent. Transpose by shifting the starting pitch class. Open-string keys (E, A, G) allow bass-string pedal tones underneath.

**Motives in this family**: intro_01, intro_13, intro_14, outro_02, outro_07

---

## ASC_LINE_TURNAROUND

**What it is**: An ascending bass line or melodic figure that walks up to the V chord. Often paired with swinging or bouncy feel. The inverse of DESC_LINE.

**Gravity**: front_door (ascending line targets V, which then resolves to I)

**Zone-tritone connection**: Ascending chromatic steps cross zones on every half-step. Ascending whole-steps stay in zone (lateral drift) until a half-step crossing creates the final pull to V.

**Cadential function**: Almost always an intro device — builds energy toward the first downbeat.

**Transposition rule**: Bass line intervals are fixed (major or chromatic). Key changes shift starting note but preserve the ascending contour.

**Motives in this family**: intro_03, intro_04

---

## SEMITONE_APPROACH

**What it is**: Resolution by moving a chord up or down one semitone to the home key. The classic bII -> I (e.g., F7 -> E7) or bVI -> V approach. Barrett calls this "the not entirely unexpected semitone chord movement."

**Gravity**: semitone (zone-crossing half-step = maximum directional energy)

**Zone-tritone connection**: This is the purest zone-cross cadence. The approach chord sits in the opposite zone from the target. The half-step motion crosses zones, creating the strongest possible gravitational pull.

**Cadential function**: Overwhelmingly an outro device (5 of 5 instances). Provides finality by arriving at I via the most direct route.

**Transposition rule**: Any chord can be approached from a semitone above. The device is universal across all 12 keys.

**Motives in this family**: outro_01, outro_03, outro_05, outro_06, outro_11

---

## DIM_PASSING_ENGINE

**What it is**: Diminished chords used as chromatic passing devices between dominant 7th chords. "You get the diminished by simply dropping down a fret" (Barrett). Creates smooth chromatic voice-leading between functional harmony.

**Gravity**: front_door + dim_chromatic (diminished chord bridges two tritone axes)

**Zone-tritone connection**: A diminished 7th chord contains two interlocking tritones from different axes. This makes it a pivot between two dominant functions — it connects two tritone axes in a single voicing.

**Cadential function**: Intro device. Creates harmonic motion without explicit V-I; the diminished chord *implies* dominant function.

**Transposition rule**: Diminished chords are symmetric (repeat every 3 frets). The passing motion works in any key — just place the dim chord between the two target dominants.

**Motives in this family**: intro_05, intro_11

---

## DOUBLESTOP_EXPRESSIVE

**What it is**: Double-stop bends, licks, and harmonized figures as the primary texture. Hendrix, SRV, Peter Green territory. The double-stop is both melodic and harmonic — two voices moving together.

**Gravity**: varies (front_door, static, or expressive depending on context)

**Zone-tritone connection**: When double-stops move chromatically, they cross zones in parallel. Bent double-stops create microtonal zone ambiguity — the pitch is between zones during the bend, resolving to one zone at the target.

**Cadential function**: Used in both intros and outros. More about texture and attitude than cadential function.

**Transposition rule**: Double-stop shapes on guitar are string-pair specific. Transpose by shifting position, but watch for string-pair changes across the neck.

**Motives in this family**: intro_08, intro_18, intro_20, outro_10, outro_13, outro_17, outro_18, outro_20

---

## CHORDAL_COLOR

**What it is**: Extended voicings — 9ths, 11ths, 13ths, #9 chords — as harmonic color. Jazzier feel, Eric Johnson shimmer, sophisticated harmony. "Rake through those 9th chords" (Barrett).

**Gravity**: front_door (chord extensions don't change the underlying tritone axis)

**Zone-tritone connection**: Extensions add pitch classes from both zones to the chord. A 9th chord includes the root's zone and the opposite zone. A #9 chord (the "Hendrix chord") contains both the major 3rd and minor 3rd — one from each zone — creating maximum zone tension within a single voicing.

**Cadential function**: Both intros and outros. Provides harmonic sophistication without changing the gravity type.

**Transposition rule**: Voicing shapes are grip-specific on guitar. Many require thumb-and-fingers technique. Transpose by moving the grip; watch for open-string voicings that don't move cleanly.

**Motives in this family**: intro_02, intro_19, outro_04, outro_19

---

## STATIC_RIFF

**What it is**: A repetitive riff or vamp with no turnaround or V-chord resolution. "This classic pattern is one of those that doesn't need turnarounds or V chord tomfoolery — it is what it is!" (Barrett).

**Gravity**: static (stays in zone; rhythmic energy replaces harmonic gravity)

**Zone-tritone connection**: By avoiding half-step motion, the riff stays within one zone. This is why it feels stable but insistent — there's no zone-crossing gravity, so the energy comes from rhythm and attack, not harmonic pull.

**Cadential function**: Intro device. Establishes the groove without setting up V-I resolution.

**Transposition rule**: Riff patterns are often open-string dependent (E, A). Transposing may require barring or octave shifts.

**Motives in this family**: intro_07, intro_17

---

## PENTATONIC_LEAD

**What it is**: Solo-based phrasing built on the pentatonic scale. SRV, BB King, Robben Ford, Clapton vocabulary. "Pentatonic based licks" leading to chromatic ideas or standalone phrases.

**Gravity**: varies (front_door when targeting resolution, expressive when freestanding)

**Zone-tritone connection**: The minor pentatonic (1, b3, 4, 5, b7) spans both zones. The major pentatonic (1, 2, 3, 5, 6) also spans both zones. Pentatonic phrasing alternates zones naturally, with chromatic approach notes (blue notes) adding explicit zone-crossing gravity.

**Cadential function**: Both intros and outros. In intros, establishes attitude. In outros, provides climactic energy.

**Transposition rule**: Pentatonic box shapes are position-based. Transpose by shifting position. The "blues curl" (quarter-tone bend) is key-independent.

**Motives in this family**: intro_06, intro_12, outro_09, outro_12, outro_14, outro_16

---

## EXPRESSIVE_MINIMAL

**What it is**: Maximum emotion from minimum notes. Bends, vibrato, and touch are the learning target, not harmonic motion. "Wringing as much emotion out of as few notes as possible" (Barrett).

**Gravity**: expressive (tension from performance technique, not chord function)

**Zone-tritone connection**: Bends create continuous pitch space between zones. A half-step bend crosses from one zone to the other. A quarter-tone bend sits *between* zones — ambiguous, suspended, bluesy. Vibrato oscillates across the zone boundary. This is where zone theory meets physical expression.

**Cadential function**: Both intros and outros. The motive's power comes from touch, not from where it lands harmonically.

**Transposition rule**: Expression is key-independent. The same bend/vibrato techniques apply in any position. Focus on the interval quality (quarter-tone, half-step, whole-step) rather than the absolute pitch.

**Motives in this family**: intro_09, intro_10, intro_16, outro_08

## ROCK_BLUES_HYBRID

**What it is**: Rock-influenced blues — gain, power chords, Jimmy Page symmetry, Van Halen endings. "A straight four to the bar instead of a swung or 12/8 feel" (Barrett). Crosses the blues-rock boundary.

**Gravity**: static (rhythmic drive replaces harmonic gravity)

**Zone-tritone connection**: Power chords (root + 5th) are zone-neutral — both notes are always in the same zone (a perfect 5th = 7 semitones = odd interval = zone-crossing... but since power chords lack the 3rd, there's no tritone, so no dominant gravity). The energy is purely rhythmic.

**Cadential function**: Both intros and outros. In intros, grabs attention with energy. In outros, provides dramatic finish.

**Transposition rule**: Power chord shapes and riff patterns transpose freely. Gain and attack style are key-independent.

**Motives in this family**: intro_15, outro_15

### Structural Observations

1. **Front-door gravity dominates** (22/40 motives). The V->I resolution is the spine of blues intro/outro vocabulary.

2. **Semitone approach is outro-exclusive**. The bII->I device only appears in endings — it creates finality, not setup.

3. **Static and expressive archetypes have no tritone axis**. They generate energy through rhythm and touch, not harmonic gravity. This is the boundary where zone-tritone analysis ends and performance pedagogy begins.

4. **Double-stops are the most common texture** (8/40). They are archetype-neutral — double-stops appear across gravity types. The doublestop is a *vehicle*, not a harmonic function.

5. **Every intro-outro pair shares a key and backing track**. Easy/Advanced pairs (1-2, 3-4, etc.) show the same harmonic skeleton at two difficulty levels. The archetype often changes between Easy and Advanced versions — the same gravity, different texture.
