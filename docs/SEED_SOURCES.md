# Seed Sources
**Canonical policy for ingesting, cataloging, and using "seed material"** in the Zone–Tritone / zt-band / String Master ecosystem.

This document exists to prevent drift: it defines *what a seed is*, *where it lives*, *how it's used*, and *what is explicitly out-of-scope*.

---

## 1) Definitions

### Seed
A **seed** is any musical artifact used as input to our system to produce:
- practice content (exercises, playlists)
- accompaniment patterns (grooves, comping)
- harmonic analysis (zones, gravity chains)
- derived libraries (style registries, pattern packs)

Seeds may be **audio**, **MIDI**, **symbolic chord text**, or **pattern data**.

### Derived Asset
A **derived asset** is anything produced by our tooling (analysis, transformation, extraction, re-voicing, variation generation). Examples:
- extracted groove patterns (our data structure)
- converted chord progressions into `.ztprog` / `.ztplay` / `.ztex`
- "style templates" that drive zt-band accompaniment

**Key rule:** derived assets must retain clear provenance.

### Provenance
Every seed and every derived asset must be traceable back to:
- its source category
- source identifier (file path, URL, task id, etc.)
- transformation steps (if applicable)

---

## 2) Source Categories

We support these seed categories. Each category has different constraints.

### A) `handcrafted`
**Meaning:** created directly by us (or instructor-authored content) with explicit intent.

**Typical forms:**
- `.ztprog` progressions
- `.ztex` exercises
- custom MIDI patterns authored in DAW or code

**Allowed uses:**
- full commercial use
- redistribution and packaging is allowed (subject to your own license)

**Provenance requirements:**
- creator name/handle
- created date
- optional references (tunes, books, lessons) if relevant

---

## Seed Governance (AI Agent Rules)

AI agents MAY:
- Create `.seed.json` metadata stubs using the template.
- Create placeholder entries that reference a human-provided source.
- Validate schema, required fields, and file placement.

AI agents MAY NOT (without explicit human approval):
- Add or ingest third-party audio/MIDI assets into `seeds/`.
- Assert license terms, ownership, or provenance as "verified."
- Pull seeds from online services or APIs.
- Generate seeds from copyrighted material.

Approval required for:
- Any new seed asset file (audio/MIDI/stems)
- Any seed source labeled `licensed_third_party` or `ai_generated_external`

Enforcement:
- CI may enforce that `source_reference` and `license_notes` are non-empty for non-handcrafted categories.

---

### B) `public_domain_or_open`
**Meaning:** legitimately public domain or openly licensed materials.

**Typical forms:**
- public domain songs
- CC0/CC-BY MIDI packs (with attribution as required)

**Allowed uses:**
- depends on the license (must comply with attribution/share-alike)

**Provenance requirements:**
- license type + link
- attribution text (if required)
- source URL and retrieval date

---

### C) `licensed_third_party`
**Meaning:** third-party content you have a license to use (vendor packs, paid libraries, subscriptions).

**Typical forms:**
- purchased MIDI packs
- licensed backing tracks

**Allowed uses:**
- limited by license
- often "use in your productions" but **not** "redistribute the raw assets"

**Provenance requirements:**
- vendor name
- product name
- license notes (short, practical summary)
- purchase date

---

### D) `ai_generated_external`
**Meaning:** music generated by external AI services (example: Suno), including stems/MIDI exported from those systems.

**Why this exists:** it can be a constant source of variation and high-quality "style snapshots" for practice/training.

**Typical forms:**
- downloaded audio
- stem-separated audio
- stem-derived MIDI exports
- metadata (prompt, style tags, key/tempo guesses)

**Allowed uses (practical default posture):**
- treat as **licensed content inside the platform** for practice, lessons, and backing playback
- allow use in *your music productions* if your plan/license allows
- avoid shipping raw exports as a standalone "pack" unless the service terms explicitly allow redistribution

**Provenance requirements:**
- provider: `suno` (or other)
- plan tier at time of generation (if relevant)
- generation id / task id / audio id
- date generated
- transformation steps (e.g., "stem separation", "MIDI extraction")

**Important note:** This policy does not claim legal conclusions; it defines *our engineering posture* so we don't accidentally build a workflow that violates terms.

## 3) What We Use Seeds For

### 3.1 Pattern Extraction (Groove/Style)
We may extract from a seed:
- rhythmic "hit maps"
- comping density
- bass motion tendencies
- velocity profiles (optional)
- form markers (A/B sections) where identifiable

Output becomes a **StylePattern** or equivalent internal structure.

### 3.2 Harmonic Annotation / Zone Mapping
We may analyze chord sequences to produce:
- tritone axes
- "gravity chains"
- zone-cross events
- substitution suggestions (tritone subs, chromatic dominants)

Output becomes:
- printed annotations (markdown/json)
- `.ztex` overlays for exercises

### 3.3 Variation Generation
We may use seeds to generate:
- new voicings
- reharmonizations consistent with the canon
- transposed cycles (all 12 keys)
- probabilistic "gravity walks" (Markov-ish)

Output becomes:
- `.ztprog` programs
- `.ztplay` playlists
- practice packs

---

## 4) Storage Layout (Recommended)

Repo-level structure (example):

```
programs/               # .ztprog reusable chord programs
playlists/              # .ztplay chaining programs into sessions
exercises/              # .ztex tasks + prompts layered on programs

seeds/
  handcrafted/
  public_domain_or_open/
  licensed_third_party/
  ai_generated_external/
    suno/
      raw/
      stems/
      midi/
      meta/
  derived/
    patterns/             # extracted groove/style patterns (json/yaml)
    annotations/          # generated markdown/json analysis
    reports/              # docs generated from seeds (optional)
```

---

## 5) Metadata Standards (Minimum)

Every seed should have an adjacent metadata file, recommended `*.seed.json`.

Example: `seeds/ai_generated_external/suno/meta/track_001.seed.json`

```json
{
  "source_category": "ai_generated_external",
  "provider": "suno",
  "created_at": "2025-12-29",
  "plan_tier": "pro_or_premier",
  "suno_task_id": "TASK_ID_HERE",
  "suno_audio_id": "AUDIO_ID_HERE",
  "assets": {
    "audio": "seeds/ai_generated_external/suno/raw/track_001.wav",
    "stems": [
      "seeds/ai_generated_external/suno/stems/track_001_instrumental.wav",
      "seeds/ai_generated_external/suno/stems/track_001_vocals.wav"
    ],
    "midi": [
      "seeds/ai_generated_external/suno/midi/track_001_bass.mid",
      "seeds/ai_generated_external/suno/midi/track_001_keys.mid"
    ]
  },
  "tags": ["ballad", "swing", "C_major"],
  "notes": "Used as seed for style extraction + practice variation."
}
```

---

## 6) Do / Don't Guardrails

### DO

* Keep seeds and derived assets separate
* Track provenance for everything
* Use AI-generated external seeds as **internal training/practice/backing material**
* Extract *our own* patterns/representations from seeds for pedagogy and engine evolution
* Prefer shipping **derived structures** rather than raw third-party exports

### DON'T (default posture)

* Don't redistribute raw external AI exports (audio/MIDI) as a standalone "pack" unless terms explicitly allow it
* Don't present third-party licensed assets as "public domain"
* Don't lose provenance (no orphan files in seeds/ or derived/)

---

## 7) Implementation Hooks (Where this plugs in)

### zt-band

* `.ztprog` and `.ztplay` remain canonical for harmony/program content
* seed-derived patterns live in `derived/patterns/` and can be loaded into `STYLE_REGISTRY` later

### Exercises / Interactivity

* `.ztex` is where "task + interaction metadata" lives
* seeds supply the *backing/audio/MIDI material* and the platform supplies the prompts + tracking

---

## 8) Future Extensions

Not required now—listed so the path is baked in.

* A `seed ingest` CLI to register new seeds and auto-create `*.seed.json`
* A `pattern extract` CLI to convert MIDI/audio seeds into internal StylePattern JSON
* A "seed-backed exercise" mode where `.ztex` references a seed asset (audio) instead of `.ztprog`

---

## 9) Canonical Summary

Seeds power variation; provenance protects the ecosystem.

**Rule of thumb:**

* ship **our** derived representations
* store **third-party** raw assets with provenance
* keep the interactivity layer independent so we can evolve grading/UI later without rewriting seeds
