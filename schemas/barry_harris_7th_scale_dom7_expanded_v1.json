  "summary": "EXPANDED INFERENCE: Includes 6th-diminished scale, enclosures, guide-tone targeting \u2014 common Barry Harris pedagogy but NOT explicitly stated in source transcript. Use maj7_v1 for source-grounded minimal rules. Adds b6 passing tone between 5 and 6, creating 8-note scale where chord tones land on downbeats.",

    ],
    "why_it_works": "By adding a chromatic passing tone, the scale has 8 notes instead of 7. When played as continuous 8th notes starting on a downbeat, all 4 chord tones (1-3-5-b7) land on downbeats and all non-chord tones land on upbeats. This forces rhythmic discipline: the player cannot 'cheat' timing because wrong notes on strong beats are immediately audible. The constraint makes timing errors self-correcting."
