# Canonical Pedagogical Sequence

The Zone-Tritone System must be taught in layered progression.
Skipping levels risks misunderstanding or drift.

## Core Concepts

### The Two Zones

The chromatic scale divides into two **whole-tone zones** based on pitch-class parity:

| Zone | Pitch Classes | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Zone 1** (even) | {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10} | C, D, E, F#, Ab, Bb |
| **Zone 2** (odd) | {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11} | C#, Eb, F, G, A, B |

**Key insight**: Every pitch belongs to exactly one zone. Zone membership determines intervallic behavior.

### Zone Motion Rules

| Interval Type | Zone Behavior | Energy |
|---------------|---------------|--------|
| **Half-step** (1 semitone) | Crosses zones | Directional (tension/resolution) |
| **Whole-step** (2 semitones) | Stays in zone | Lateral (drifting) |
| **Tritone** (6 semitones) | Stays in zone | Axis (functional equivalence) |

### The Six Tritone Axes

A **tritone axis** is a pair of notes 6 semitones apart. There are exactly six unique axes:

| Axis | Notes | Zone |
|------|-------|------|
| (0, 6) | C / F# | Zone 1 |
| (2, 8) | D / Ab | Zone 1 |
| (4, 10) | E / Bb | Zone 1 |
| (1, 7) | C# / G | Zone 2 |
| (3, 9) | Eb / A | Zone 2 |
| (5, 11) | F / B | Zone 2 |

**Key insight**: Both members of a tritone axis always share the same zone. This is why tritone substitution works - it preserves the gravitational function.

### Gravity and Dominant Function

In a dominant 7th chord, the **3rd and 7th** form a tritone. Two dominant chords a tritone apart share the same tritone axis:

G7:  B(3rd) + F(7th) = axis (5, 11)
Db7: F(3rd) + Cb/B(7th) = axis (5, 11)

This is **tritone substitution**: same tritone axis = same gravitational pull = interchangeable dominants.

### The Gravity Chain

Root motion by descending perfect 5th (7 semitones) traces the **cycle of fourths**:

G -> C -> F -> Bb -> Eb -> Ab -> Db -> Gb -> B -> E -> A -> D -> [G]

Each step moves to the target of the previous dominant. This is the fundamental gravity of tonal harmony.

## Level 1 - Zone Awareness

**Objective**: Recognize and feel zone membership without labels.

### What to Learn

1. **Parity intuition**: Even pitch classes (C, D, E, F#, Ab, Bb) feel Zone 1. Odd pitch classes (C#, Eb, F, G, A, B) feel Zone 2.

2. **Zone-same intervals**: Whole steps and tritones stay in zone. Play C-D-E-F#-Ab-Bb - all Zone 1.

3. **Zone-cross intervals**: Half steps cross zones. Play C-C#-D-Eb - alternating zones.

### Practice Protocol

1. Play any note. Name its zone (even = Zone 1, odd = Zone 2).
2. Play a whole step up. Confirm same zone.
3. Play a half step up. Confirm zone crossed.
4. Repeat until zone membership is instant, not calculated.

### Assessment Criteria

- Identify zone membership of any note within 1 second
- No counting semitones - pure recognition

---

## Level 2 - Gravity Recognition

**Objective**: Identify tritone anchors by ear and symbol.

### What to Learn

1. **Tritone sound**: The tritone (augmented 4th / diminished 5th) is the most unstable interval. Learn to hear it.

2. **Axis membership**: Given any note, instantly know its tritone partner (add 6 semitones mod 12).

3. **Dominant tritone**: In any dom7 chord, locate the 3rd and 7th. They form the tritone.

### The Tritone Partner Table

| Note | Partner | Axis |
|------|---------|------|
| C | F# | (0, 6) |
| C# | G | (1, 7) |
| D | Ab | (2, 8) |
| Eb | A | (3, 9) |
| E | Bb | (4, 10) |
| F | B | (5, 11) |

### Practice Protocol

1. Play any dom7 chord. Identify the 3rd and 7th.
2. Play both notes together - hear the tritone.
3. Find the tritone sub chord (root a tritone away). Play it. Same gravitational pull.
4. Resolve both to their shared target.

### Assessment Criteria

- Name tritone partner of any note instantly
- Identify tritone sub pairs by symbol (G7 and Db7)
- Hear dominant function in both members of a tritone pair

---

## Level 3 - Motion Training

**Objective**: Experience half-steps as directional energy.

### What to Learn

1. **Resolution direction**: Half-steps have inherent direction. 7 to 1 resolves up. 4 to 3 resolves down.

2. **Voice leading efficiency**: The best voice leading moves by half-step. Minimizes energy, maximizes clarity.

3. **Zone crossing as tension-release**: Every half-step creates or releases tension by crossing zones.

### The Resolution Map (Major Key)

| Scale Degree | Resolves To | Direction | Motion |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| 7 (leading tone) | 1 (tonic) | Up | Half-step |
| 4 | 3 | Down | Half-step |
| b7 (in dom7) | 3 (of target) | Down | Half-step |
| 3 (of dom7) | 1 (of target) | Up | Half-step |

### Practice Protocol

1. Play a dom7 chord. Identify the tritone (3rd and 7th of the chord).
2. Resolve each voice by half-step:
   - 3rd of dom7 to root of target (up)
   - 7th of dom7 to 3rd of target (down)
3. Feel the zone crossing on each resolution.
4. Practice tritone resolution in all 12 keys.

### Assessment Criteria

- Resolve any dom7 to its target with correct voice leading
- Feel the direction of each half-step without thinking
- No wrong resolutions (3 going down, 7 going up)

---

## Level 4 - Dual-Zone Competence

**Objective**: Operate fluently inside melodic-minor hybrid systems.

### What to Learn

1. **Altered dominants**: Melodic minor from a half-step above the root = altered scale. Same tritone, different colors.

2. **Lydian dominant**: Melodic minor from a 4th above = Lydian dominant. Same tritone, bright tension.

3. **Zone navigation**: Both zones active simultaneously. Switch fluently.

### The Melodic Minor Modes for Dominants

| Mode | Formula | Zone Behavior |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Mixolydian** | 1 2 3 4 5 6 b7 | Standard dominant |
| **Lydian b7** | 1 2 3 #4 5 6 b7 | Tritone sub feel |
| **Altered** | 1 b2 #2 3 #4 b6 b7 | Maximum tension |
| **Half-whole diminished** | 1 b2 #2 3 #4 5 6 b7 | Symmetric, both zones |

### Practice Protocol

1. Take a II-V-I in any key.
2. Play the V chord with each dominant scale option.
3. Notice how the tritone (3 and b7) stays constant.
4. Feel which colors belong to which zones.

### Assessment Criteria

- Play altered, Lydian b7, and mixolydian over any dom7
- Identify zone membership of each scale tone
- Smoothly transition between scale choices

---

## Level 5 - Composition in Gravity

**Objective**: Compose using gravity maps instead of chord-symbol lists.

### What to Learn

1. **Gravity chains**: Plan progressions by dominant function, not chord spelling.

2. **Axis substitution**: Any chord on the same tritone axis can substitute. Use this for reharmonization.

3. **Markov thinking**: Model root motion as probability. Common progressions have high transition probability.

### The Gravity Chain Generator

Starting from any root, generate a dominant cycle by descending perfect 5ths:

Start: G -> C -> F -> Bb -> Eb -> Ab -> Db -> Gb -> B -> E -> A -> D -> G

Each step represents a V to I resolution. The entire chain is one gravitational system.

### Practice Protocol

1. Pick a tune. Extract the root motion only (ignore chord quality).
2. Map each transition: same zone? cross zone? tritone axis?
3. Identify the gravity center (most common resolution target).
4. Reharmonize using tritone subs while preserving gravity.

### Assessment Criteria

- Analyze any standard in terms of gravity chains
- Reharmonize without breaking voice leading
- Compose an 8-bar progression using gravity logic only

---

## Level 6 - Mastery Philosophy

**Objective**: Express emotional control through intentional harmonic design.

### What to Learn

1. **Tension as expression**: Zone crossings create tension. Control them = control emotion.

2. **Gravity as narrative**: Progressions tell stories. The gravity chain is the plot.

3. **Tritone as pivot**: The tritone is the hinge. Master it, master harmony.

### The Mastery Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Determinism** | Same input produces same output. No randomness in resolution. |
| **Constraint-driven** | Limits create expression. Fewer choices = stronger voice leading. |
| **Feel before theory** | The body knows before the mind. Train reflexes first. |
| **Guitar-first** | All theory must translate to fretboard positions. |

### The Final Test

Compose an original 32-bar piece that:
1. Uses all six tritone axes
2. Contains at least one gravity chain of 4+ steps
3. Resolves every dominant correctly
4. Includes at least one tritone substitution
5. Can be played without looking at chord symbols

---

### Rule

**No advanced concepts may be presented out of order.**

The Zone-Tritone System is designed for cumulative mastery. Each level assumes complete internalization of previous levels. Testing should gate advancement - do not proceed to Level N+1 until Level N passes all assessment criteria.

## How Exercises Connect to the Framework

The pedagogical sequence above defines *what* students learn at each level. The exercise library defines *how* they practice it. Every exercise family maps back to a specific zone-tritone concept:

| Exercise Family | Primary Concept | Level |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Zone identification drills** | `zone(pc) = pc % 2` — instant parity recognition | 1 |
| **Enclosures** | Zone-crossing half-steps approach chord tones from above and below | 2-3 |
| **Pivot patterns** | Pivot note sits in the same zone as two chord tones; resolution crosses zones | 3 |
| **Guide-tone voice-leading** | 3rds and 7ths form the tritone; tracking them tracks the engine | 3-4 |
| **Drop-2 shell voicings** | Minimum harmonic information = the tritone (3rd + 7th) | 3-4 |
| **Chromatic triplet chains** | 3-note cells cross zones to land on chord tones; zone-alternating pattern | 3-4 |
| **Gospel backdoor cadence** | Dual gravity — both V7 and bVII7 pull to tonic via different tritone axes | 4-5 |
| **Tritone substitution studies** | Same axis, different bass — dominant equivalence class | 4-5 |
| **Barry Harris 6th diminished** | Interleaved chord tones and diminished passing tones alternate zones | 4-5 |
| **Phrygian gravity** | bII-I zone-cross layered with parent minor tritone resolution | 4-5 |
| **Gravity chain progressions** | `r = (r - 7) % 12` — repeated dominant resolution as a single generator | 5 |
| **Reharmonization** | Axis substitution preserves gravitational function while changing color | 5-6 |

### Design Principle

Exercises are not separate from the theory — they are the theory made physical. When a student practices an enclosure, they are training zone-crossing reflexes. When they practice guide-tone voice-leading, they are tracking the tritone as it resolves. The framework does not merely *describe* the exercises; it *generates* them.

This alignment means:

- **Tagging is principled**: exercises can be categorized by which zone-tritone concept they train
- **Assessment is grounded**: pass criteria reference observable gravity events (chord tone on beat 1, clean resolution, correct voice-leading)
- **Progression is structural**: moving from Level 1 to Level 6 means practicing exercises that engage progressively deeper zone-tritone mechanics

## Quick Reference

### Zone Membership Formula

    zone(pitch_class) = pitch_class % 2
    # 0 = Zone 1 (even), 1 = Zone 2 (odd)

### Tritone Partner Formula

    tritone_partner(pc) = (pc + 6) % 12

### Zone Crossing Check

    is_half_step(a, b) = (b - a) % 12 in {1, 11}
    # Half steps always cross zones

### Gravity Chain Formula

    next_root(r) = (r - 7) % 12  # Descend by perfect 5th
