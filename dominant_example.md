# Zone–Tritone EXPLAIN

## Chord progression

`C7 F7 Bb7`

## Per-chord gravity anchors

| # | Chord | Root | pc | Zone   | Tritone axis (3,7) |
|---|-------|------|----|--------|---------------------|
| 0 | `C7` | C | 0 | Zone 1 | E–Bb |
| 1 | `F7` | F | 5 | Zone 2 | Eb–A |
| 2 | `Bb7` | Bb | 10 | Zone 1 | D–Ab |

## Step-by-step transitions

| From | To | Interval | Zone relation | Explanation |
|------|----|----------|---------------|-------------|
| C | F | 5 st [↑4] | Zone 1 → Zone 2 (zone-cross) | reverse 4th motion (preparation / back-cycle movement) |
| F | Bb | 5 st [↑4] | Zone 2 → Zone 1 (zone-cross) | reverse 4th motion (preparation / back-cycle movement) |

## Gravity comparison

**Theoretical gravity chain (descending 4ths):**

`C → F → Bb`

**Actual progression:**

`C → F → Bb`

## Reading guide

- **Descending 4th (↓4)** steps align with pure functional gravity.
- **Semitone (±1)** steps are chromatic zone-crossings (strong directional pull).
- **Whole-step (±2)** in-zone steps are modal / color motion.
- Other moves are deliberate tension against the gravity grid.

Use this to see how the tune rides, follows, or pushes against the gravity field.
